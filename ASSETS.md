# Branding & Visual Assets

This document defines the visual identity and asset generation strategy for the SubSkills (SubSkills).

## 🎨 Visual Identity
The branding focuses on **Technical Precision, Scalability, and Clean Architecture.**

- **Primary Colors:** Deep Space Blue, Neon Cyan (Highlights), Neutral Gray (Backgrounds).
- **Style:** Minimalist Cyber-Grid, Data-Flow Visualizations, Isometric Architectural Schematics.

## 🖼 Branding Assets

### 1. The Matrix (Hero Image)
*   **Concept:** A vast, organized grid of technical capabilities.
*   **Visuals:** An infinite isometric plane of neon-blue nodes, representing the Skill Library. Digital data-lines flow between nodes, signifying orchestration.
*   **Prompt:** *Cinematic wide-shot, 16:9. A vast digital grid representing a high-performance capability matrix. Deep navy blue background with glowing cyan nodes and interconnected data-lines. Minimalist technical aesthetic, high contrast, sharp focus, 4k resolution.*

### 2. The Engine (Pipeline Visual)
*   **Concept:** The transformation of requirements into executed tasks.
*   **Visuals:** A stylized flow diagram showing requirements entering a high-tech processing core and emerging as structured capabilities.
*   **Prompt:** *Isometric 3D schematic of a technical orchestration engine. Clean architectural lines, glowing data flow entering a central processing unit. Cyberpunk-minimalist style, blue and silver accents, bokeh background, professional tech branding, 8k.*

### 3. The Portal (Interface/CLI)
*   **Concept:** Seamless integration between the user and the skill library.
*   **Visuals:** A glowing terminal window displaying a high-speed skill-discovery sequence.
*   **Prompt:** *Close-up of a futuristic computer terminal window. Glowing cyan code scrolling rapidly, displaying "SKILL DISCOVERY IN PROGRESS". Sleek UI elements, glassmorphism effects, dramatic lighting, high-tech engineering aesthetic.*
